Hello there! I call this game Shoot The Rings (honestly for lack of a better name :)). It is a 2d game developed in Python with the Kivy library.

Click on the "?" icon button on the game's screen when you start the game to understand how its controls.

All you have to do are move, rotate, shoot and survive for as long as possible!

If I do continue working on this game, I plan to add a few more things like gamepad controls support. I think I should also change the jet to something else - maybe a car, or a tank?

Have some fun while playing.
